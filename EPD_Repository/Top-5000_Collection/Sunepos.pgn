{1927 Alekhine won the 34th game in the battle vs Capablanca to become World
Champion. He did it by playing 1.Ra4! in the above position. Black's rook has
to block the pawn and white has at his disposal an endless reserve of rook
moves along the a-file. Again, the future for black spells "Zugzwang". The
general rule is that a passed pawn should be supported by a rook from the rear.
That's why ideas of 1.Rd5? are wrong. This is a knowledge that have to be
implemented in many chessprograms. I have seen numerous examples of trying to
support such a pawn sideways.    What would your favourite program play?} 1.

on c6 (2.Nc6). Mr Doubt stared at the position. Naturally he couldn't believe
his own eyes...shuffled up the pieces and left the room without a word.
