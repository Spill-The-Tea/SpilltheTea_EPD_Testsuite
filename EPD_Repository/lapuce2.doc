*******************************************************************************


This FAQ is intended to give readers informations on the LCT II Chess Computer
Test, in 10 questions and answers (at least for this version).

1) What is the LCT II Chess Test ?
It is a set of 35 chess positions designed to evaluate the strength of Chess
Programs and Chess Computers. It gives a good approximation of the
International Elo rating of a program.

The test is available via a ZIP file, LCTII121.ZIP, which you can download
from Mads Brevik chess page (http://knoll.kih.no:8001/stud/mads2/chess.htm)
or I can send it directly to you, just drop me a word about it in my mail.

LCTII121.ZIP contains the following files :

* README.TXT : General information, history, instructions for PC chess programs.
* RATINGS.TXT : Some results on Pentium 90 and Pentium Pro 200

2) Who is the author of the LCT II ?
Me. Ah, ah.
Well, my name is Frederic Louguet, born in Boulogne, France, in 1963.
I am a freelance journalist, writing articles and books about computer hardware 
and software, especially on Computer Graphics and 3D Image Synthesis.
And, of course, I love Chess, and computers. That's why I created this test,
which is published every three months by "La Puce Echiqueenne", Paris, France.


3) What is "La Puce Echiqueenne" ?
This is the french magazine of reference on Computer Chess. Reviews, technical 
informations, games, analysis, databases, etc. It is published by ACTIV-ECHECS,

4) What is the main idea behind the LCT II ?

Yes, there is an idea ! I strongly believe that, in a lot of well-known tests,
too much importance is given to tactical positions. Tactics are important, but 
not THAT important. After all, combinations appear only when there are 
positional weaknesses in a position, allowing tactical moves to be effective.
But if you look at the whole game, you can see that positional moves are much
more frequent than tactical moves.

So the idea behind the LCT II is to give positional play the place it deserves.
There are 35 positions in the test : 14 of them are positional, 12 are tactics
and 9 are endgames. So 40% of the overall rating can be obtained by doing a
perfect score on positional tests.


5) What were my goals in creating the LCT II ?

The test must :

* Give a good approximation of the International Elo rating of a program, by
correctly balancing relative importance of positional play, tactics and endgames.

* Be available to everybody who wants to test his own chess computer or program.
However, it must be strong, because the test is only valid for Elo greater
than 1900.

* Be simple to use. No coefficients, no complicated formulas. The program get
points each time it solves a position in a certain amount of time (see question
7 for the details). You just add all the points to 1900, and you get an
approximation of the International Elo rating.

* Have a good number of positions, but not too much. It must be run in a few
hours, so it is possible to test a program on different hardware, with different
hash-table sizes, with different styles. It can provide a lot of useful
information.


6) Was there an LCT I test ?

Yes. The first version of this test was created in July, 1992, for the first
issue of La Puce Echiqueenne. It was a bit more complicated than it is now,
but it worked OK. Of course, the LCT II is much better, and was introduced in
issue #8 (November 1994).


7) How do I run the test ?
First, you must have a Chess computer or a Chess program on a PC or a
Workstation. Then you have to follow this procedure :

* The program tested must be configured to level : Infinite.

* Permanent brain must be disabled. Some programs begin their analysis in setup
mode, so it is very important to disable this option.

* Learning tables must be disabled (or moved elsewhere on the disk during the
tests).

* The program must run each test during 10 minutes (600 seconds). At 10:01
(601th second), you must stop the analysis.

* The time to keep is the time when the program finds the best move and does
not change his mind until the ten minutes are over. For example : the best move
(A) is found in 32 seconds, but the program change his mind at 1'56 and now
prefers (B). Later, he again considers (A) as the best move after 7'16, and 
does not change anymore until 10:01. So 7'16 is the time to put in the results.

* It is very important to let the program "think" 10 minutes, and particularly
for positional tests, since some programs change their mind frequently.
For tactical tests, it is of course not necessary.

* Points attributed : 

30 points if move found between 0 and 9 seconds (included)
25 points if move found between 10 and 29 seconds        
20 points if move found between 30 and 89 seconds     (30" - 1'29)
15 points if move found between 90 and 179 seconds    (1'30 - 2'59)
10 points if move found between 180 and 389 seconds   (3' - 6'29)
5 points if move found between 390 and 600 seconds    (6'30 - 10')
0 points if move not found in 10 minutes

The lower limit is 1900 Elo points.
For example, if a program gets 105 points (positional), 200 (tactical) and
70 (endgame), its rating will be 1900 + 105 + 200 + 70 = 2275.
The upper limit is 1900 + (30 points * 35 tests) = 2950 points.
That is 40 % for positional moves, 34 % for combinations and 26 % for endgame.

You can see from these figures that it is useless to test entry-level programs 
or Chess computers with the LCT II test. It is clearly intended for strong ones.


8) Can the LCT II Elo be compared with the Swedish Rating List Elo ?

It was not intended to be compared with the SSDF List in the first place, but
it is inevitable that such comparisons occur. In fact, I have found that the
LCT II correlation with the Swedish Rating List is quite high. Here are a few
examples, taken from the 1995/10/31 list. In these examples, all programs were
tested on Pentium 90, but you can find similar figures on slower hardware :

Program		LCT II		SSDF

Genius 3.0	2425		2447
Rebel 6.0	2405		2430
Hiarcs 3.0	2440		2420
MChess Pro 4	2360		2377
Fritz 3		2380		2371

It seems good enough, doesn't it ? More interesting, in some cases the LCT II
predicted these scores before the SSDF. For example, the rating of M Chess Pro
4.0 was 2396 in the 1995/09/08 version of the SSDF list, and it has now come
down 19 points, to be only 17 points more than the LCT II rating.

Of course, 35 positions can not replace thousands of games, but it can give a
good indication of the strength of a new program, only days after it is
available to the public, not months. Do not forget another thing : the SSDF
list is based on Computer against Computer matches, and it is clear that some
programs perform better against humans than against other computers. So I think
that the SSDF List is a very useful tool, but that there is also a need to have
a good general purpose test.

 
9) Where can I send my test results ?

You can send your LCT II results by fax or E-Mail to ACTIV-ECHECS
(see question 3) or directly to my E-Mail, which is : louguet@worldnet.net.
Please don't forget to mention your configuration (PC or Workstation, CPU, RAM,
cache, hash-tables).

If you have comment or suggestions, I will be pleased to hear them. Suggestions 
for a future LCT III will also be considered.


10) An LCT III test ?
 
Well, there will definitely be a LCT III test. Why ? because I have already a
few ideas to make the test even better. When, I don't know, because I have a
lot of other things to do before ! And I can assure you that the conception
of the LCT II took a LARGE amount of time...

So the answer is probably : not before 1997. Nevertheless, I will be
collecting material in the meantime. So if you have good positions that are
difficult and interesting enough, please send them to my E-Mail (see 9).
Maybe they will be included in the LCT III.

Thanks for reading this FAQ.

How to use the 35 LCT II tests
------------------------------ 

Each program tested must be configured to level : Infinite.

- Permanent brain must be disabled. Some programs begin their analysis in 
setup mode, so it is very important to disable this option.

- Learning tables must be disabled (or moved elsewhere on the disk during
the tests).

- The program must run each test during 10 minutes (600 seconds). 
At 10:01 (601th second), you must stop the analysis. 

- The time to keep is the time when the program finds the best move
and does not change his mind until the ten minutes are over.
For example : the best move (A) is found in 32 seconds, but the program
change his mind at 1'56 and now prefers (B). Later, he again considers (A) as
the best move after 7'16, and does not change anymore until 10:01. So 7'16
is the time to put in the results. 

- It is very important to let the program "think" 10 minutes, and particularly 
for positional tests, since some programs change their mind frequently. For
tactical tests, it is of course not necessary.

- Points : 

	30 points if move found between 0 and 9 seconds  
	25 points if move found between 10 and 29 seconds        
	20 points if move found between 30 and 89 seconds     (30" - 1'29)
	15 points if move found between 90 and 179 seconds    (1'30 - 2'59)
	10 points if move found between 180 and 389 seconds   (3' - 6'29)
	5 points if move found between 390 and 600 seconds    (6'30 - 10')
	0 points if move not found in 10 minutes

The lower limit is 1900 Elo points.
For example, if a program gets 105 points (positional), 200 (tactical) and 
70 (endgame), its rating will be 1900 + 105 + 200 + 70 = 2275. 
The upper limit is 1900 + (30 points * 35 tests) = 2950 points.
That is 40 % for positional moves, 34 % for combinations and 26 % for endgame.
